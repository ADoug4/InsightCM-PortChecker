PortChecker User Stories

Vibration Analyst/IT
I'm responsible for collecting and analyzing vibration data at my plant, but communication 
is down between the InsightCM Server and the CMS device. Or I might be getting started and want 
to test the system before I start. I was told I need to use this tool to verify that the ports 
are open between the cRIO and server. I want the tool to be as simple as possible to use. 
There should be clear documentation on how to use the tool. I shouldn't need to initiate a 
remote connection between the Server and my laptop to use the tool. A single "start test" 
button should be sufficient to run the test. The tool should have a professional feel and look. 
The tool should be easy to install and use. I don't want to have to connect to our network at 
multiple points to run the test. 

TSE/AE
Our customer is having communication issues between their CMS device and InsightCM server. I 
need a tool to send the customer to check if all ports are open to communicate successfully. I need to 
be able to understand the code by looking at the block diagram. I need to understand the troubleshooting
process associated with this tool so I can coach the customer. I should be able to send this to 
the customer easily and quickly. The customer should be able to send me a readable log file.
